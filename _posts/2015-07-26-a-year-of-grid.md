It's been almost a year since [GRiD](http://umassamherst-grid.github.io/), also known as *Graduate Researchers interested in Data*, was founded at UMass Amherst. This is a group operated by graduate students, for graduate students, with the goal of promoting data science across campus.

From the beginning, we have been dataset and programming language agnostic. The goal was not to learn R, Python, or Julia, neither to apply the ideas in the study of very specific sets of data. Those were desirable, of course, but they would (probably) come naturally during our research work as graduate students. Instead, what we tried to do was create a community of people from different disciplines with a common focus; To learn from each other and develop our skills, plus start creating some "Hacker culture" at the graduate student level, which was currently missing from UMass. 

## A bit more history
After becoming an official graduate student organization and starting with a crowd of about fifteen people (there was a minimum number of members needed in order to be able to apply to be a graduate student group), we began having weekly meetings. The point was to discuss new ideas and give presentations to each other on tools we understood well. At the same time, we tried to reach out to other departments, letting graduate students know of our new thing, either via e-mail chains or by giving presentations in classes. 

The response was incredible. Within one week of our little "promotion", we had over thirty people interested in following what we were doing. By week three, over a hundred. And not just graduate students. Even professors working in data science were interested in being part of the talk and, through the [Western Mass Data Science, Stats, and R group](http://www.meetup.com/Pioneer-Valley-and-Five-College-R-Statistical-Meetup/), even professionals from industry. We rarely had so many people join our meetings but we consistently had about 50% of our members open and read new e-mails.

All this interest made us feel more confident that we were on a good path. Also, more ambitious in what we could accomplish. 

## A year of events

It's not difficult to imagine that the bar can be set pretty high when you have so many talented people driven to learn and teach others. Apart from very interesting talks by local professors versed in the techniques and science, like [Professor Michael Lavine](http://people.math.umass.edu/~lavine/) or [Professor Erin Conlon](http://umassamherst-grid.github.io/talk-by-professor-erin-conlon/), we organized our very own [visualization workshop](http://umassamherst-grid.github.io/visualization-meeting/), where students introduced their favorite tools to others. 

Then, with the help of one of our group's advisors, [Professor Nicholas Reich](http://people.umass.edu/nick/), we synchronized with Harvard to organize the second data-driven Hackathon at UMass Amherst, called "HackEbola (with Data!)". This was open to any student, regardless of undergrad or grad status and was [very successful](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/hack/files/hackebolawithdatasummary.pdf) in generating new insights on Ebola. Our group got a [fair bit](https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-plans-weekend-long-) [of](https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/hackebola) [press](http://mobile.gazettenet.com/home/14466582-108/hackebola-at-umass-aids-fight-against-west-african-epidemic) because of this event too!

Even though our group was open to undergraduate students to come and take part in the discussion, we thought it would be important enough for our group to keep on accepting only graduate students as members. We wanted to keep both undergrads and grads motivated enough to work on projects that are appropriate for the knowledge level each had at the time. Since we believed that knowledge accumulates more rapidly when many people of same level work together, we kept our group a graduate student group and assisted with the creation of [uGRiD](http://umassugrid.wix.com/ugrid#!about/c240r), the first undergraduate group at UMass with a focus on data science. 

Those may have seen like enough major events for a year, but this is only the fall semester! During the spring, we joined as assistants to a team of scientists organizing the [Five-College ASA DataFest 2015](http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/math/datafest/). Given that the original idea for GRiD was conceived during the 2014 DataFest, there was no way it could have gone differently. We just had to help! 

And help we did, both in organizing the different aspects of the DataFest and in recruiting our members as consultants for the three-day competition.

To close with the academic year, we used some of our funds to travel to Boston with about twenty of our members to have a talk with the data team for the Red Sox. We had a very interesting discussion with them and learned a lot about how analytics influence real world decisions and make a big difference.

## One eye on the future

To sum up, it was a very productive year, both for GRiD and for data science on campus. The [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.umass.edu) announced a new [Center for Data Science](http://ds.cs.umass.edu/) on campus. The Center announced a B.S and M.S. with a data science concentration. And of course, the Center will facilitate greater collaboration with scientists across campus and five colleges on data science related projects. As a group, we are definitely paying a lot of attention to the new possibilities that can come up through UMass CS.
