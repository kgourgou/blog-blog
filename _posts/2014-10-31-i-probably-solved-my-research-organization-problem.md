During research or coursework, I generally need to keep track of a lot of files. These are either papers that I download or code that I write or even tex files with my notes. Even though I have most of them with me through dropbox, I am guessing that it's better to organize them now that is early, before I have to start writing my thesis. 

To organize them, I paused and thought what exactly would fit my needs. I would need a tool with the following characteristics. 

1. Should be something easy to use. 
2. Should support writing formulas with latex and (if possible) markdown for everything else.
3. Should somehow help categorize the rest of my files and allow me to search for them, when needed. 
4. Should be something that I can edit locally, without needing to use the internet. 

For a while, I was using evernote to do this work, since it covers 1 and 3. However, I believe I now have found a better solution, keeping a private wiki! 

[Gitit](http://gitit.net/) is such a wiki that covers all the points above and also supports version control via git (hence the name). Seems to work pretty well thus far.
