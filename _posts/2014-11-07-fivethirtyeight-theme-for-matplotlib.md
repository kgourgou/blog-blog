Just a note, so that I won't forget that you can now produce graphs with the beautiful FiveThirtyEight style from matplotlib! You can find the details [here](http://dataorigami.net/blogs/napkin-folding/17543615-replicating-538s-plot-styles-in-matplotlib).

In matplotlib 1.4, you can change plot styles through the function *style.use()*. For example, for FiveThirtyEight, use style.use('fivethirtyeight'). 

Tied up with plotly, the result is pretty cool.
