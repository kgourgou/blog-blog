Happiness. I passed my first edX course, one called [Learning From Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse), taught by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa. It was a cool course, covering the basics of machine learning and including a good chunk of mathematical info. More specifically, among other things, we went over, 

* The perceptron learning algorithm. 
* Differences between learning & design. 
* When (and how) is learning feasible. 
* The linear model.

This was the first time I played around with machine learning. It was very interesting and gave me new ideas. Soon, I will "push" a little something on the perceptron algorithm, just to give a taste.
