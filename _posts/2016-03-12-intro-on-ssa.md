My current plan for this is the following.

1. Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (with an on-lattice example). 
2. Parallel version of the SSA.
3. Some stuff about the analysis of the parallel version and the operator splitting framework.
4 Long-time results about the parallel version and information theory. 

I may add more sections as I go. But I thought it would be interesting to have some posts that I could tie together with a common theme.

Intro to SSA is coming up soon! :-)
