My current plan for this is the following.

1 Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (with an on-lattice example). 
2 Parallel version of 1.
3 Some stuff about 2. and the operator splitting framework.
4 Long-time results about 2. and information theory. 

I may add more sections as I go. But I thought it would be interesting to have some posts that I could tie together with a common theme.

Number 1. is coming up soon! :-)
