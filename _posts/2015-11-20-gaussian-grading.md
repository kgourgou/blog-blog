Here's an idea on how to grade your exams/papers/etc., potentially faster while keeping your morale high. This will work better when answers are standardized, i.e. there is only one correct answer and it only takes a few seconds to verify that the answer is completely correct. I can't say I discovered the method, but it's the one I use when I grade.

I assume that you have N exams to grade, with one question each (if it's more than that, just grade one problem at a time). But how can you grade them faster? 

## Why is progress slow in the first place?
I have noticed the following. When I grade, I only slow down and think when it's time to assign partial credit, for example, when the answer is not completely correct but parts of it are. When that happens, I look at my rubric, and if it's a case I have already documented, then I grade it. Otherwise, I have to spent some time thinking about how to assign partial credit. If there is a lot of variation in the possible answers, then it becomes difficult to have a complete rubric. 

## Enter "Gaussian Grading"
This is an obvious strategy with the goal of reducing mental strain throughout grading. Here's how it works. First, you pick the top paper from your to-grade stack. You look at the problem and you assess how difficult it is to grade. If it would take less than a few seconds (meaning that it's either a zero or completely correct), then you grade it and move on. Otherwise, you move it to a new stack, which will from now on be called the "future stack". You keep on going this way until your to-grade stack runs out (all exams are either in the future stack or graded). 

If the problem was too easy or too hard, the bulk of the exams should be done. The exams in the future stack will need a bit more thought but you can feel happy if this way you cleared out more than 50%.

And it goes on. Your future stack is now your new to-do stack. This time you make a rubric for the simplest of mistakes and carry on in the same way, only tackling the easy ones. As you move on, you will now know what kind of errors you should expect in the future stack, and that stack will get smaller and smaller with every pass. 

## Why "Gaussian"?
Normally (no pun intended), the distribution of grades in an exam follows a bell-shaped curve around some average grade. This is what we call in mathematics a Normal or Gaussian distribution. If we could just grade in binary (fail/pass), then the process would be simple. However, it is often unreasonable to deduct points from a student that has most of the answer right except for unfortunate numeric mistakes. Then, one needs to figure out a consistent way to assign partial credit, which is where most graders spent time. :-)

In classical academic style, here's a list of the advantages of this method.

1. It provides a sense of "getting-things-done" as you progress through the stack faster (at least in the beggining). 
2. It allows you to make a better rubric, since you will have some partial knowledge from the whole stack, not just a small sample. 
3. If the tails of the distribution (of grades) are rather big, then after a couple of iterations the future stack will only have a small number of papers.
4. It doesn't take more time than the classical "sample, make rubric, grade all papers" approach but it could take less. :-)

And some cons.

1. If the distribution of the grades is concentrated around the average grade, it will take more iterations to get done. :-(
2. If seeing partially-complete exams gets you down, this method is not for you. After one iteration, that's all you would have left to grade. Some people like to think that there are still perfect exams in their stack.
